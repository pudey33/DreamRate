# Progress

## Completed Features
- ✅ Supabase integration for dream data
- ✅ Data transformation layer (Dream → DreamView format)
- ✅ Scrollable DreamView list in main content area
- ✅ Authentication state handling
- ✅ Loading, error, and empty states
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
- ✅ Sidebar functionality preserved (click disabled as requested)

## Current Status
The landing page now successfully:
1. Fetches 10 random dreams from Supabase when user is authenticated
2. Transforms Supabase dream data to work with existing DreamView component
3. Displays dreams as a scrollable feed in the main content area
4. Handles all authentication states (logged out, loading, error, empty, success)
5. Maintains sidebar with sample dreams (click functionality disabled)

## Data Flow
1. User authentication triggers `fetchRandomDreams()`
2. `getRandomDreams($user.id, 10)` fetches from Supabase
3. `transformDream()` converts each dream to DreamView format:
   - `story` → `text`
   - `created_at` → formatted `date`
   - `tags` JSONB → colored tags array
   - `rating` set to 0 (placeholder for unreviewed dreams)
4. Dreams displayed as individual DreamView components in scrollable list

## Technical Implementation
- Updated Dream type to include optional `tags` field
- Created data transformation functions
- Implemented reactive data fetching based on user authentication
- Added comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Styled new layout with CSS for all states

## Known Limitations
- Dreams show rating 0 since they're unreviewed (as expected)
- Infinite scroll not implemented (saved for future enhancement)
- Individual dream rating functionality disabled (handled by feed layout)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- Implement infinite scroll for loading more dreams
- Add dream rating/review functionality
- Enhance search and filtering capabilities
- Add dream creation workflow
