# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully removed navigation controls from DreamView components for the scrollable feed layout.

## Recent Changes
Streamlined the DreamView component by removing all navigation-related functionality:

1. **Removed Navigation Props**: Eliminated `canGoNext`, `canGoPrevious`, `currentIndex`, and `totalCount` props
2. **Removed Navigation Functions**: Deleted `handleNext()` and `handlePrevious()` event handlers
3. **Removed Navigation HTML**: Eliminated the entire navigation controls section (Previous/Next buttons and "x of x" counter)
4. **Cleaned Up CSS**: Removed all navigation-related styling (`.navigation-controls`, `.nav-btn`, `.dream-counter`)
5. **Updated Landing Page**: Simplified DreamView component usage to only pass the `dream` prop

## Technical Implementation
- **Simplified Component Interface**: DreamView now only requires the `dream` prop
- **Cleaner Layout**: Each dream is self-contained without navigation clutter
- **Better UX**: Perfect for scrollable feed where users scroll through dreams naturally
- **Maintained Functionality**: Rating system and action buttons remain intact

## Current Status
ðŸŽ¯ **NAVIGATION REMOVAL COMPLETE** - The DreamView component is now streamlined for the scrollable feed layout. Each dream displays independently without navigation controls, creating a clean social media-style feed experience.

## Benefits Achieved
- **Cleaner Interface**: No confusing navigation controls in a scroll-based layout
- **Better Performance**: Reduced component complexity and prop passing
- **Improved UX**: Natural scrolling behavior without navigation distractions
- **Simplified Code**: Easier to maintain and understand component structure

The DreamRate app now has a modern, streamlined feed layout perfect for browsing community dreams!
