# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully integrated Supabase dream data into the DreamRate landing page.

## Final Implementation
The landing page now:
1. Fetches 10 random dreams from Supabase when user is authenticated
2. Displays them as a scrollable feed in the main content area using DreamView components
3. Handles all authentication states (logged out, loading, error, empty, success)
4. Preserves sidebar with sample dreams (click functionality disabled as requested)

## Key Issue Resolved
**Database Schema Mismatch**: The critical issue was that we were mapping `dream.story` when the actual database field is `dream.content`. This has been fixed in:
- `Dream` TypeScript interface (updated to use `content` field)
- Data transformation function (now correctly maps `dream.content` â†’ `text`)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Query Fix**: Resolved `RANDOM()` syntax error with client-side randomization
- **Data Transformation**: 
  - `content` â†’ `text` (fixed field mapping)
  - `created_at` â†’ formatted date
  - `tags` JSONB â†’ colored tag objects
  - `rating` set to 0 (placeholder for unreviewed dreams)
- **Layout**: Scrollable DreamView list in main content, sidebar preserved
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive states for all scenarios

## Current Status
ðŸŽ¯ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - The DreamRate landing page now successfully displays real dream content from Supabase in a scrollable feed format as requested.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- Implement infinite scroll for loading more dreams
- Add dream rating/review functionality
- Enhance search and filtering capabilities
